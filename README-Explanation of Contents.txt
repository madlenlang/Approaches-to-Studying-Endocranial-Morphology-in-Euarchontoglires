Approaches to Studying Endocranial Morphology in Euarchontoglires: Assessing sources of error for a novel and biologically informative set of landmarks (2023) Journal of Mammalian Evolution.  

Orientation_Trials_Script  
	This script relates to the trials of the six orienting landmarks presented in Supplementary Information SI8 (Tab S8, S9ab, Fig S2).
	Data used for this includes landmarks folder: "Orientation_Landmarks", and classifier: "EG-GM-Orientation-Classifier.csv".  

Landmark_Trials_Script
	This script relates to the trials full set of 30 fixed landmarks (Tab 2.1, Tab 2.2, Fig 2.1, SI2-SI4, SI7).
	Data used for this includes the landmark folder: "Trial_Landmarks.csv", the classifier: "EG-GM-Trials-Classifier.csv", and the wireframe: "wireframe.txt."
	
EG_GM_Ptilocercus 
	This script relates to the analysis of intraspecies error (Fig 2.1B). 
	Data used for this includes landmarks folder: "GM_Ptilocercus_Landmarks", "B-Spline-1-ascii-Ptilocercus", "B-Spline-2-ascii-Ptilocercus", and classifier: "GM-Ptilocercus-Classifier.csv".
	
GM_EGxTrials_Script
	This script relates to the analysis of interobserver error relative to species variation (Fig. 2.1A). Trials of the 3 landmarks species are included with the full set of 40 Euarchontoglires. 
	Data used for this includes the landmark folders: "EG_Landmarks_Combined", and classifier: "EG-GM-Combined-Classifier.csv".
	
EG_GM_SlidingLM
	This script relates to the analysis of 40 species of Euarchontoglires includeing the sliding landmarks (Fig 2.3) as well as the LaSEC analysis (Fig 2.2). 
	Data used for this includes the landmark folders: "EG_Landmarks", "B-Spline-1-ascii-Sliding", "B-Spline-2-ascii-Sliding", and classifier: "EG-GM-Sliding-Classifier.csv".
